Description of a virtual function table instance to be used during
construction or destruction of a class that has overridden virtual
functions in virtual base classes.  In such cases, a virtual function
table instance is needed for a base class (call it A) for use while
executing the constructor/destructor for a derived class (call it B)
where the complete object type is actually some further-derived class
(call it C).  We call this the virtual function table instance for
"A in B in C".  The set of overriding functions is determined by B
(i.e., no overriding functions in derived classes of B are considered),
but the layout -- and therefore the delta value in the virtual function
table entry -- is determined by C.

A list of these represents an array of virtual function table instance
addresses.

Macro that returns TRUE if the type specified by tp contains a function type
with a parameter type that is passed via a copy constructor.  Such parameter
types are rewritten during lowering to use a pointer (see
add_indirection_to_cctor_param_type).  Cases where the copy constructed
parameter is cv-qualified result in lowered function types that are
incompatible with cv-qualified destinations in initializations, assignments and
function calls.  Note that this test is sub-optimal in that it only checks for
parameters being passed via copy constructor, not for ones that are also
cv-qualified.  This is because the cv-qualifiers may already have been removed
during lowering.  The result is that we may add a cast where none is necessary.
Casts are not needed for pointer to member function types.
