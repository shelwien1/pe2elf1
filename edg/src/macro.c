curr_char_loc points to an LE_RAW_OR_EXPANDED_ARGUMENT lexical escape.
Immediately following is the ATTENTION_MARKER of a deletion source line
modification whose deleted text is the raw version of a macro argument.
Immediately following the deleted text is an ATTENTION_MARKER of a deletion
source line modification whose deleted text is the expanded version of the
macro argument.  Depending on the value of use_raw_version_of_arg, remove
one or the other of those source line modifications and change the
LE_RAW_OR_EXPANDED_ARGUMENT lexical escape to an LE_END_OF_TOKEN so this
routine will not be invoked twice for the same argument.

This is used to support the following Microsoft idiosyncrasy.  Given the
macro definitions

    #define M1(x) M2(##x)
    #define M3 xyz

and an invocation

    M1(M3)

whether the argument to M1 is expanded to xyz or left as M3 depends on the
characteristics of M2.  If M2 is a macro that uses its argument as an
operand of a paste (##) operator, the raw version of M3 is used; otherwise,
the expanded version is used.  For example, with

    #define M2(x) abc ## x

the result will be abcM3, while with

    #define M2(x) abc x

the result will be abc xyz.  To support deferring the determination of
whether to use the raw or expanded version of the argument until its
eventual use is known, both versions are copied into the expanded text with
their text deleted, the modifications are marked with the
is_raw_or_expanded_arg flag (to prevent the deletions from being compacted
if the macro buffer is expanded), and the construct preceded by an
LE_RAW_OR_EXPANDED_ARGUMENT lexical escape.  When macro_invocation is about
to read the first token of a macro argument, it sets use_raw_version_of_arg
according to whether the corresponding parameter is used in a paste
operation, and skip_white_space calls this routine whenever it encounters
an LE_RAW_OR_EXPANDED_ARGUMENT lexical escape.

Check if the operator to which rtp points (an rt_paste or
rt_microsoft_magic_arg_marker) is followed by an empty substitution of the
variadic macro parameter.  If so, and if it is immediately preceded by a
comma (optionally followed by white space), the comma is generally removed
(along with any white space).  (The removal does not occur in Microsoft
mode when the comma appears inside a macro argument list.)  This strange
behavior is emulated for Microsoft variadic macros and when extended
variadic macros are enabled.  Some preprocessors (notably from the GNU
project) implement this to work around the following problem:

	#define M(fmt, args) printf(fmt , ## args)
	void f() { M("Hello.\n"); }

Without the "deletion effect", the macro would generate an extraneous
comma.  (The Microsoft variety of variadic macros does this even without
the "##" operator.)  kind describes what kind of section preceded the
operator.  rtp points to the replacement text sections starting at the
rt_paste or rt_microsoft_magic_arg_marker.  n_params is the number of
parameters in the macro.  arg_values is a pointer to an array of
a_macro_arg_ptr elements: it is referred to by the get_arg_value macro and
hence its name should not be changed.  *length is the value to be adjusted.
In non-Microsoft mode, *length is set to exclude the comma.  In Microsoft
mode, we don't know yet whether the comma will appear in a macro argument
list or not, so *length is set so that an LE_MICROSOFT_MAGIC_COMMA lexical
escape and a comma can be inserted and *add_escape is set to TRUE,
indicating to the caller the need to do so.  This lexical escape allows
skip_white_space to determine when the text is rescanned whether the comma
will be suppressed or not in the expanded text.  *add_escape is set to
FALSE in all other cases.
