The copy address is normally a direct pointer to the primary (canonicalized)
address where the given entry will be copied or remapped to (in the primary
IL).  When merging there is an intermediary address used (see f_mark_to_merge
for more information about the merge).  In this latter case,
transitive_copy_address_of always reaches the former case transitively through
the intermediary address.

If there is no corresponding entry in the primary IL (and this is not a string
entry -- string entries are handled by copy_string_entry itself) this function
will allocate a new entry in the primary IL and use that address as the copy
address.

known_will_process_in_curr_walk is TRUE if it is known that the entry has been
or will be processed (and not merely have its address remapped) in the current
IL walk.  If it is not known that an entry will be processed and
copy_address_setup is invoked as part of copy_from_secondary_to_primary_IL,
copy_address_setup will ensure the entry and its IL subtree are copied as
needed.

Mark the given entry (of kind "kind") as one that must be merged with its

The merge process occurs in effectively two phases.  The merge process starts
with the first phase when copy_from_secondary_to_primary_IL is called.  During
this phase IL will be copied from the secondary translation unit to a "remapped
copy."  The remapped copy is a temporary copy of the IL entry with all pointers
remapped to IL entries in the primary IL memory region.  The remapped copy
itself is allocated in the secondary translation unit's IL memory region and is
thus dropped along with the secondary translation unit's IL following the
merge.

The merge operation is then completed in its secondary phase, during the final
(manual) walk of the translation unit, facilitated by finish_trans_unit_copy.
For entries that were marked for merging the copy address returned points to
the remapped copy.  The primary IL entry's address is then obtained from the
copy address of the remapped copy.  As all pointers at this point reachable
from the remapped copy refer to entries in the primary IL, information can be
safely and freely moved from the remapped copy to the primary IL entry (thus
facilitating the merge).

Note: copy_address_setup will be called to set the copy address if it is not
