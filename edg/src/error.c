           // If my_struct<&some_function> appears in a diagnostic, the above
           // function type results in a non-visible typedef usage being
           // detected by is_or_contains_typedef_type.
           my_struct<&some_function> *a1;

           // The front end associates "x" with the struct, so if this appears
           // in a diagnostic it will appear with a redundant name.
           typedef struct { } x;

         this results in the front end printing out a redundant "aka".  These
         cases are non-trivial to detect via traversal and aggressively culling
         them can result in valid cases not being handled correctly.  Thus, we
         perform this post-processing check for the redundancy in the
         "rendered" type name and (when the names match) revert the msg_buffer
         to its prior state.

         Similarly note, when a typedef is in a namespace that inhibits typedef
         dealiasing, is_or_contains_typedef_type will still return TRUE (to
         keep the said function straight forward).  form_type handles the
         actual process of ignoring the normal rules for ignoring dealiasing.
         Thus, if the produced "aka" type name is equivalent to the original
         type name, this code handles the associated cleanup.
