#if LOWER_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ARRAYS

/*
The front end can be configured to transform variable-length array IL
into plain C89 IL by setting the macro LOWER_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ARRAYS to TRUE.
The allocation and deallocation of VLA storage is handled by portable
routines in the run-time support library (these routines ultimately rely
on the standard malloc and free functions).

By way of example, this VLA code snippet:

  void f(int n, int m) {
    int v[n][m];
    n = v[1][m];
  }

generates this lowered C pseudo-code:

  void f(int n, int m) {
    auto long __T8592264;
    auto long __T8592528;
    auto int *v;
    ((__T8592264 = n) ,
     (__T8592528 = m)) ,
     (__T8592264 *= __T8592528);
    __vla_alloc((void *)(&v), (__T8592264 * 4L));
    n = (((int *)(&(v[(__T8592528 * 1)])))[m]);
    __vla_dealloc((void *)(&v));
  }

As can be seen in the example, VLA variables are lowered to a pointer to the
underlying type of the array (int in this case).  Storage for the VLA is
allocated at the beginning of the scope in which the VLA is defined by calling
the __vla_alloc run-time routine.  VLA storage is likewise deallocated by
calling __vla_dealloc when the variable goes out of scope.  VLAs are found only
in function and block scopes and are never static.

Temporary helper variables (e.g., __T8592264 and __T8592528 in the example
above) are created to hold the size of significant components of variable
dimensions.  The temporary helper variables are used to properly scale
operations involving a VLA operand.  See lower_vla_dimensions for a full
description.

In addition to rewriting operations for scaling purposes, operations involving
the lvalue of a VLA expression must be rewritten.  For example, the lvalue of
a VLA variable (really a pointer in the lowered code) is replaced by an
indirection through the VLA variable (see lower_vla_variable_lvalue).
Such operations are identified during the lowering of expressions.

VLA types are also lowered to non-VLA types.  A VLA type, 'array [EXPR] of T',
or 'array [EXPR] of array [EXPR] of T' are both lowered to 'T', and VLA
variable types are lowered from 'array [EXPR] of T' to 'pointer to T'.
Multi-dimensional VLA variable types are also lowered to 'pointer to T'.  This
VLA type lowering process consists of these three steps:

1)  During lowering, types that contain a VLA component are identified by calls
    to record_vla_component_types_for_lowering and queued (on the vla_types
    list) for later processing.  No changes to VLA types are made at this time
    (the type contains information about VLA dimensions).

2)  After expressions have been lowered in a scope, the type of each VLA
    variable and parameter in the scope is modified to be a pointer to its
    previous (still VLA) type.

3)  Lastly, in lower_vla_types, the entire list of VLA types is walked and each
    VLA type is replaced with the underlying element type.

There are "variably-modified" types, which are types that contain a VLA but
aren't just a VLA (e.g., a pointer to VLA).  Static variables can have
variably-modified types, even though they can't have VLA types.

The expressions in a VLA are evaluated at the point of declaration
(as indicated by an stmk_set_vla_size statement), either of a VLA variable or a
variable with a variably-modified type.  (Or a cast that uses a
variably-modified type.)

The front end produces a stmk_vla_decl statement at the point of declaration of
a variable or typedef with a variably modified type.  Lowering uses this as a
trigger to produce a call to the __vla_alloc run-time call (when the
stmk_vla_decl refers to a variable).  For the others, there's no allocation.

In C mode, the point of deallocation is indicated by an enk_vla_dealloc
expression node (see VLA_DEALLOCATIONS_IN_IL).  In C++ mode, the deallocation
is handled by the object lifetime mechanism (the deallocation is like
destruction of a variable on exit from its scope).

When LOWER_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ARRAYS is FALSE, the back end must be prepared to
handle variably modified types, as well as stmk_set_vla_size and stmk_vla_decl
statements, and enk_vla_dealloc nodes (when VLA_DEALLOCATIONS_IN_IL is TRUE).

/*
Fixed-point lowering:
--------------------

When LOWER_FIXED_POINT is TRUE, fixed-point constructs are lowered
to standard C.  Fixed-point types are lowered to appropriately-
sized integral types; fixed-point constants are lowered to
integral constants; and fixed-point operations and casts are
lowered to calls of runtime routines.  The runtime routines
are not supplied by EDG.  They can be obtained from Dinkumware, Ltd.
(www.dinkumware.com).

Here's an overview of the runtime interface.

First, let's define a generic container called an "fxvalue"
that can hold the bits of any fixed-point value or any integer value:

  typedef unsigned long long fxvalue;

The underlying type is configurable, but usually it's the largest
integer type, e.g., unsigned long long if that is supported.
It must be big enough to fit all target integers and also all
fixed-point types represented in integral form.  For values taking
less than the full set of bits, the bits of the value are placed
at the least-significant end of the fxvalue (this is done simply
by casting; having the fxvalue type be unsigned prevents sign
extension).

Next, let's define a 5-bit field called an "fxtype" that describes
the type contained in an fxvalue.  Starting from the least-significant
bit:

(2 bits) Precision: 00 short
                    01 default
                    10 long
                    11 integral operand
(1 bit)  Kind:       0 _Fract
                     1 _Accum
(1 bit)  Sign:       0 signed     ]
                     1 unsigned   ]--- also used for integral operands
(1 bit)  Saturation: 0 not _Sat
                     1 _Sat

Next, let's define a 3-bit field called an "fxcontrol" that
describes the pragma state at the point of an operation.
Starting from the least-significant bit:

(1 bit)  FX_FRACT_OVERFLOW   0 DEFAULT
                             1 SAT
(1 bit)  FX_ACCUM_OVERFLOW   0 DEFAULT
                             1 SAT
(1 bit)  FX_FULL_PRECISION   0 OFF
                             1 ON

This may not be used by the runtime (and in fact at the moment the
EDG front end always passes zeroes for those bits).

These fields are combined into several sets of bits that 
describe operand and result types and pragma state.  In each case,
the fields are listed starting from the least-significant bit:

fxmask1: fxcontrol, fxtype for operand (also gives result type)
fxmask2: fxcontrol, fxtype for operand 1, fxtype for operand 2,
         fxtype for result
fxmaskr: fxcontrol, fxtype for operand 1, fxtype for operand 2
fxmaskc: fxcontrol, fxtype for operand, fxtype for result
fxmaskf: fxcontrol, fxtype for operand
fxmaskg: fxcontrol, fxtype for result

The integral types in which these are passed are configurable,
but the default (to match the Dinkumware runtime) is unsigned short
for all fxmasks except fxmask2, which is passed as unsigned long.

The runtime routines are as follows:

// Unary operators:
fxvalue _Fixed_negate(fxmask1, fxvalue);
fxvalue _Fixed_incr  (fxmask1, fxvalue);  // Used for ++
fxvalue _Fixed_decr  (fxmask1, fxvalue);  // Used for --

// Binary operators:
fxvalue _Fixed_add     (fxmask2, fxvalue, fxvalue);
fxvalue _Fixed_subtract(fxmask2, fxvalue, fxvalue);
fxvalue _Fixed_multiply(fxmask2, fxvalue, fxvalue);
fxvalue _Fixed_fivide  (fxmask2, fxvalue, fxvalue);

// Relational operators:
int     _Fixed_eq      (fxmaskr, fxvalue, fxvalue);
int     _Fixed_ne      (fxmaskr, fxvalue, fxvalue);
int     _Fixed_gt      (fxmaskr, fxvalue, fxvalue);
int     _Fixed_lt      (fxmaskr, fxvalue, fxvalue);
int     _Fixed_ge      (fxmaskr, fxvalue, fxvalue);
int     _Fixed_le      (fxmaskr, fxvalue, fxvalue);

// Shift
fxvalue _Fixed_shiftl  (fxmask1, fxvalue, int shift_count);
fxvalue _Fixed_shiftr  (fxmask1, fxvalue, int shift_count);

// Conversion
//   Fixed to (other) fixed, fixed-point to integer, and
//   integer to fixed
fxvalue     _Fixed_conv        (fxmaskc, fxvalue);
//   Fixed to floating-point
float       _Fixed_to_float    (fxmaskf, fxvalue);
double      _Fixed_to_double   (fxmaskf, fxvalue);
long double _Fixed_to_ldouble  (fxmaskf, fxvalue);
//   Floating-point to fixed
fxvalue     _Fixed_from_float  (fxmaskg, float);
fxvalue     _Fixed_from_double (fxmaskg, double);
fxvalue     _Fixed_from_ldouble(fxmaskg, long double);

Conversions to/from complex and imaginary are handled by using
the floating-point conversions on the real part and/or an
appropriate zero.

Compound assignments are handled by rewriting, e.g.,
x += 1 is turned into x = x + 1 (but x is evaluated only
once) and that is lowered.  Likewise increments and decrements
are rewritten as adds or subtracts of 1, e.g., ++x becomes
x = x + 1 and that is lowered.

"call" is an eok_call node.  If it represents a call to a known routine,
ensure that the type of the enk_routine node matches that of the
a_routine entry.  This may not be the case on entry if the call found a
block-extern declaration of the entry with a type different from an earlier
namespace-scope declaration.  Consider the following example:

  int f(int (*p)[*]);      // (1)

After the VLA-based declaration in (1) is lowered, it is no longer compatible
with the non-VLA-based type of (2) (and the latter determines the type of the
enk_routine node).  This can lead to problems in the back end.  In
particular, the C-generating back end would generate code that some C
compilers (including newer versions of GCC) do not accept.  The transformation
here (when applicable) consists in changing the type of the enk_routine
