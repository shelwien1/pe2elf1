lower_eh.c -- IL lowering for exception handling constructs.

Note that the processing here comes in three levels:

- With DO_FULL_PORTABLE_EH_LOWERING set, all EH constructs are lowered to
  C.  That means code is generated to maintain an EH stack, try/catch are
  fully lowered (using setjmp), throw is fully lowered, cleanup tables
  and typeinfo entries are generated, and __eh_curr_region is maintained.
  This mode is compatible with the C-generating back end and the minimal
  runtime supplied.  Setting DO_FULL_PORTABLE_EH_LOWERING forces the
  setting of GENERATE_EH_TABLES.
- With GENERATE_EH_TABLES set (and DO_FULL_PORTABLE_EH_LOWERING not set),
  the cleanup tables and typeinfo entries are generated, but throw/try/catch
  are retained.  Other low-level things are represented as
  enk_lowered_eh_construct expression nodes.  Also, the object address
  table is not maintained, and the handle numbers for entities in the
  cleanup tables use stack offsets represented as ck_stack_offset
  constants.  If you use this mode, you'll have to make modifications
  to the EDG-supplied runtime.
- With neither flag set, no tables are generated (but the object lifetime
  information is preserved), throw/try/catch are retained, and all other
  executable constructs are represented as enk_lowered_eh_construct nodes.
  If you use this mode, you'll have to write your own runtime routines.

The statements and expressions attached under exception handling
constructs (e.g., try/catch, throw) are lowered in all modes (as long as
IL lowering itself is done).

This must match the header file and the runtime definition.  Well, "match"
is too strong a word: the virtual function table pointer must be at the
proper offset.  The rest of the fields, and the overall size, need
not match up.

Note that even if we have the type_info type from the <typeinfo> header
(pointed to by type_of_type_info), we do not use it, because we don't
know that it has the structure that we require, and we don't know
whether it is complete at this point (it might be completed later in
the compilation).  We build a version of that type for IL lowering.

Note a notational convention (possibly overly subtle): a "type_info"
refers to a type declared in the header, and a "typeinfo" (no underscore)
refers to the corresponding type built by IL lowering.  The type
built here is considered the tik_user typeinfo type, and a call to
