layout.c -- Managing the layout of class objects, based on user
            declarations and implementation conventions.

General comments on class layout

I.  Unions

  The offset of each nonstatic data member of a union is zero bytes from
  the starting address of the union object.  Its size is large enough to
  contain the largest member, and its alignment is that of the member with
  the greatest alignment requirement.  Unions cannot have base classes so
  no space is reserved for them (nor for pointers to data sections of
  virtual base classes).  Unions cannot have virtual functions, so no
  space is reserved for a "virtual function info" field.

II.  Classes and structs

A.  C vs. C++

  C structs are a special case of C++ structs.  They are classes without
  base classes and virtual functions, so space is required for fields
  only.  Fields are put out in strict declaration order and aligned based
  on data type.  The alignment requirement for the struct as a whole is that
  of the member with the greatest alignment requirement.

  C++ classes (in the generic sense) that are not unions have more
  complicated layouts.  The language definition provides few requirements
  on how a class is laid out, so there are potential incompatibilities
  between different language processors in (1) the order and locations of
  nonstatic data members, base class data sections, and pointers to
  virtual base classes, and (2) the representation of virtual function
  information.

B.  Layout options

  The EDG C++ front end provides several options in laying out a class,
  including compatibility with the layout of AT&T's cfront and a "normal"
  option that uses memory more efficiently than cfront's layout.  There is
  also an option that controls whether fields are put out in strict
  declaration order or grouped by accessibility.  The front end can be
  configured as required by setting CFRONT_OBJECT_CODE_COMPATIBILITY and
  TARG_FIELD_ALLOC_SEQUENCE_EQUALS_DECL_SEQUENCE, both of which are
  defined in targ_def.h.

  The normal layout is as follows:

    1. Nonvirtual direct base class data sections, in declaration order.
       (Such base class data sections are referred to as "incomplete
       subobjects" because the space reserved for them does not include
       space for their own virtual base classes.  All virtual base classes,
       direct and indirect, appear at the end of layout.)  If the empty base
       class optimization is enabled (targ_optimize_empty_base_class_layout),
       then empty bases and fields with empty class type and the
       [[no_unique_address]] attribute are allocated in a separate pass after
       the nonempty bases (see set_offsets_for_empty_nonvirtual_base_classes).

    2. Nonstatic data members, in declaration order.

    3. The virtual function information "block"; in a typical
       implementation this will be space reserved for a pointer to a
       virtual function table. (An optimization allows the sharing of
       virtual function tables between a derived class and a nonvirtual
       base class, in which case this pointer will be omitted.)

    4. Pointers to direct and some indirect virtual base class subobjects.
       (A pointer-sharing optimization results in the omission of pointers
       to indirect virtual base classes in most cases.)

    5. The data sections for all direct and indirect virtual base classes.
       These appear as incomplete subobjects, in an order based on
       declaration order (namely, the order of their appearance on the base
       classes list, which is the same as the order of their construction:
       depth-first left-to-right traversal of the directed acyclic graph of
       the base classes).

  When targ_field_alloc_sequence_equals_decl_sequence is FALSE, only item
  2 of the normal layout is modified.  The order of nonstatic data
  members becomes:  all public members, in declaration order; then, all
  protected members, in declaration order; and lastly, all private members,
  in declaration order.  (This option is provided based on a suggestion
  in the commentary section of ARM 11.1.)

  When CFRONT_OBJECT_CODE_COMPATIBILITY is TRUE, items 1, 4, and 5 of the
  normal layout are affected.

    1. Nonvirtual direct base classes, in declaration order.  The first is
       an incomplete subobject; any others are complete -- i.e., space is
       reserved for their virtual base classes.  (This may result in wasted
       space, since a virtual base class may appear in association with
       more than one nonvirtual direct base class.)

    2. Nonstatic data members, in declaration order.

    3. Virtual function table pointer, unless omitted because the table is
       shared with the first nonvirtual direct base class.

    4. Pointers to direct and some indirect virtual base class subobjects.
       (The pointer-sharing optimization is the same as that for the
       normal layout.)  The order in which the pointers are put out cannot
       be summarized easily, since it appears to be an accidental artifact
       of the algorithm and internal data structures employed by cfront.

    5. All virtual base classes (generally direct but sometimes indirect)
       that are not embedded in some other subobject, in an order that
       again is an artifact of cfront's implementation.  These virtual
       base class data sections are put out as complete subobjects.

  In general, there are two advantages of the normal layout over the
  cfront-compatible layout.  First, and most importantly, it may result in
  smaller objects, since virtual base classes data sections are guaranteed
  to be put out only once.  Second, the order in which virtual base class
  pointers and virtual base class data sections appear in the layout is
  predictable, not an accident of the implementation.

  For detailed information about cfront layout compatibility issues please
  refer to the functions involved, including set_data_section_base_class
  in class_decl.c.

Scan and process a cached #pragma pack directive, which is used to control

The syntax is:

   #pragma pack()

where n is a "pack alignment", the maximum alignment that may be assigned to
any nonstatic data member (even if it is less than the normal alignment for
the member's type).  If n is omitted, the pack alignment effectively reverts
to the default value, if any, that was specified on the command line.  The
current value is stored in curr_max_member_alignment and is copied into the
type entry for a class, struct, or union when layout processing commences.

The "enhanced syntax" is also supported:

   #pragma pack(push {, name} {, n})
   #pragma pack(pop  {, name} {, n})
   #pragma pack(show)

"push" mean to push curr_max_member_alignment onto the pack alignment stack.
A name may be provided to identify the entry for a targeted pop.  When n is
specified, that becomes the new curr_max_member_alignment; otherwise the old
one is retained.  "pop" with a name means to remove all entries on the pack
alignment stack down to and including the named entry; without a name, only
the top entry is removed.  curr_max_member_alignment is then set either to n
if n is supplied or to the value associated with the last entry popped.
The only effect of "show" is to issue a warning displaying the value of
curr_max_member_alignment.

laid out) for which conflicts are considered.  subobject_type is the
type of an already allocated subobject in which a conflict is looked for.

See gnu_first_field_conflict for a description of this GNU C++ layout bug.
See also gnu_base_conflict for a similar problem with preceding empty
bases.  Yet another similar issue occurs for nearly empty virtual bases
that should normally be allocated at offset zero; in that case, in_field is
TRUE indicating that conflicts must involve a field subobject (not just a
base class of the complete object).

GNU compilers seem to consider virtual bases only during certain stages of
layout.  The flag consider_virtual_bases must be TRUE to enable consideration
of virtual bases (but the flag is always set to TRUE when considering field
types).

/*
The offset of base class proximate_derivation has been computed, but the
offsets of its own base classes have not.  The subtle aspect of this
processing is that two different base class entries are involved.  First,
the "most derived class" contains a list of all its base classes, direct
and indirect.  But each class from which it is derived has its own base
class list, too.  For example:

          A    A       class B points to base class A (path ==>A)
          |    |
          B    C       class C points to base class A (path ==>A)
           \  /
             D         class D points to base classes B (path ==>B)
                                                      A (path ==>B==>A)
                                                      C (path ==>C)
                                                      A (path ==>C==>A)

Thus, while the base classes for D, the "most derived class", are
represented by only 3 type entries (A, B, and C), there are 4 base class
entries involved, since 2 are associated with class A.  As for offsets, B's
"A" base class entry indicates the offset of the "A" data section within
the block occupied by class "B" entities, whereas the two "A" base classes
associated with class D should have offsets representing their locations
within a "D" object.  Computing the offset of an indirect base class (e.g.,
A) within a most derived class (e.g., D) requires adding the offset of the
base class immediately derived from it (e.g., B) to its own offset within
that class (e.g., A's offset within B); in other words, the D::A offset
equals the D::B offset plus the B::A offset.

The algorithm involves going through direct base classes of
proximate_derivation (in this example "B in D" is the proximate_derivation,
and it has only one direct base class of its own, namely, "A in B"),
finding the corresponding base class entry in the most derived class (e.g.,
finding the appropriate "A in D" -- the one whose path is ==>B==A), and
setting the offset field in the latter.

lob points to a block of information that describes some current state about
the layout of lob->class_type (which is also proximate_derivation->type).
