walk_entry.h -- Routines used by il_walk.c to walk IL entries.

When #include'd, this file produces definitions for one or two functions.
The first (non-optional) function will be defined with a declarator-id that is
the expansion of the macro WALK_ENTRY_ROUTINE_NAME.  The second is always a
"static" function and declared with a declarator-id that is the expansion of
the macro WALK_ORPHANED_ENTRY_ROUTINE_NAME (but if that macro is not defined,
no such function is produced).  Note that if the macros specifying the names
are qualified names (e.g., "edg::some_name"), a declaration must have been
provided earlier in the appropriate scope.

Various macros control how the routines traverse a given IL entry:

1)  With DO_SUBTREE_WALK TRUE, the routines walk not only the entry itself
    but also its subtree.

2)  With DO_SUBTREE_WALK and NEEDED_FLAG_WALK TRUE, the routines walk
    the subtree and do so in the special way required for setting the
    needed flag.  Entries related to the following are not walked
    (because they do not affect whether the entities are needed to
    create an executable program):
      -- Access control (including friendship)
      -- "using" declarations and directives
      -- The hidden name table
      -- Source sequence entries
      -- The based types list
    Also, some back-pointers are not walked if they introduce cycles
    in the data structure where no entry in the cycle has a "needed"
    flag, since such cycles would cause recursion loops in this walk.

3)  With DO_SUBTREE_WALK and KEEP_IN_IL_WALK TRUE, the routines walk
    the subtree and do so in the special way required for setting the
    keep_in_il flag.

4)  With DO_SUBTREE_WALK FALSE, the routines walk just the entry itself.
    This is used for remapping of pointers.

For the needed-flag or keep-in-il walk, walk any default argument
expressions associated with the given parameter type list, but if
we're doing the needed-flag traversal in a mode where lowering is
expected to be done, do nothing.  In a simple world, this special
traversal would not be needed: lowering clears default argument
expression pointers to NULL, and the needed and keep-in-il walks are
done after lowering, so those walks should see only NULL pointers and
never mark the expressions as needed.  However, when a (lowered) call
in a function scope memory region is walked, the function type in the
file scope is still unlowered and therefore still has attached default
argument expressions.  We don't want to mark something referenced in
such an expression as needed merely because it appears in a default
argument expression, because the default argument expression may not
be used if all the calls provide a full set of arguments.  That
suggests that we should just pretend that the default argument
pointers are NULL already, because eventually they will be, but that
doesn't work either, because there are some function types that do not
get lowered, e.g., in prototype instantiations and in casts in backing
expressions, and those default argument pointers will never be cleared
(and might have associated object lifetimes pointing to them).  Also,
it turns out to be impractical to know in general whether a given
function type will eventually be lowered.  So the pragmatic solution
is to mark the default argument expression as keep-in-il but not as
needed, which produces correct IL that possibly includes some unneeded
entities.  To improve the odds on the normal cases, default arguments
associated with function definitions are handled when the function
type is walked, which guarantees that any lowering that will occur has
already happened, and therefore that we never in that case mark
something as keep-in-il when it's not actually required.
