Definition for a function number.  Functions are stored in function
memory regions, but all function definitions within a top-level (i.e.,
namespace scope or non-local class scope) function are stored in the

When IL is written to a file, it must be possible to get from a function to
its associated scope.  This is done using the memory region and the
function number.  The memory region (from the routine entry) is used to
read the memory region.  The process of reading the IL populates the
function definition table for the functions in the memory region. The
function number is used as an index into an array that contains a pointer
to the top-level function scope.  The array also contains the memory region
number so that the memory region can be determined based only on a function
definition number (if a routine pointer is not available).
