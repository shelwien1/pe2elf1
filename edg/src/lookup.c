/*
Cfront 2.1 has a bug that causes a global identifier to be found when
a member of a class or one of its base classes should actually be found.
The following code illustrates an instance in which the bug occurs:

  struct B   {
          void func(const char*);	// Needs to be here
  };

  struct D : public B {
  public:
          D();
          void Init(const char* );
  };

  struct func {
          func( const char* msg);
  };

  D::D(){}

  void D::Init(const char* t)
  {
          new func(t);
  }

For the bad lookup to occur:

1. A member in a base class must have the same name as an identifier
   at the global scope.  Any member kind is OK -- it can be a function,
   static data member, or nonstatic data member.  Member type names don't
   apply because a nested type will be promoted to the global scope by
   cfront which disallows a later declaration of a type with the same name
   at the global scope.

2. The declaration of the global scope name must occur between the declaration
   of the derived class and the declaration of either an out-of-line
   constructor or destructor.  The global scope name must be a type name.

3. No other member function definition -- even one for an unrelated class
   may appear between the destructor and the offending reference.
   This has the effect that the bad lookup applies to only one class at
   any given point in time.

The global variable last_ctor_or_dtor_sym is set by function_declaration
when the body of a constructor or destructor that is defined outside of
the class definition is processed.  This field is cleared when any other
member function is defined.

Macro that returns the symbol kind for a nonreal member created for the

type if the lookup is a "must be class or namespace", "must be tag" or
"typename lookup".  In addition, if "implicit typename" is enabled, we
also force the member to be a type when doing a "tentative type" lookup
(but not if the name being looked up is something that could not be
a typename, like a destructor).

Implicit typename mode is used to compile code that was not written
using "typename".  If the symbol is not considered to be a class
template or a type, then it is created as a constant.

In Microsoft mode, a tentative template lookup for a member of an unknown
base results in the creations of a class template symbol.

/*
When we are doing g++ dependent name lookup the visibility of the symbol
depends on whether or not it is a function, whether the name was specified
using a template-id, and the version of g++ that we are emulating.

Symbols are sometimes visible if a using-directive was visible at the point
of definition of the template.  The using_dir_decl_seq field of the namespace
is used to determine the visibility of using-directives in g++ mode.

Consider this example:

  namespace N1 {
    template<typename T> inline void f(const T&, const T&) { }
  }

  template<typename T> inline void f(T const&, T const&) { }

  template<typename T> inline void g(T const& val1, T const& val2) {
    f<int>(val1, val2);  // call #1
    f(val1, val2);       // call #2
  }

  int v1;
  int v2;

  int main() {
    g(v1, v2);
  }

  using namespace N1;

We match the behavior of the various g++ versions, except as noted below.

Call #1 is:

  - ambiguous in g++ 3.2
  - accepted in g++ 3.3 and above, but we give an ambiguity
  - accepted in g++ 3.4 and above

Call #2 is:

  - ambiguous in g++ 3.2
  - accepted in g++ 3.3, but we give an ambiguity
  - ambiguous in g++ 3.4
  - ambiguous in g++ 4.0
  - accepted in g++ 4.1

Call #2 is accepted in g++ 4.1 because the presence of a symbol found by the
normal lookup suppresses the visibility of certain symbols that would be
found by a using-directive lookup.

Operator names seem to be visible regardless of the location of the
using-directive.

ssep is the scope stack entry at which the using-directives apply that are
being considered for this lookup.  locator identifies the kind of name being
looked up.  new_sym is the symbol being considered.  nssp is the namespace of
new_sym.  sym_from_scope is the symbol found by normal lookup in the scope in
which the using-directives apply.

This routine is called as part of normal_id_lookup processing to handle
scopes for which the symbols are now on the inactive list.  This
includes class reactivations, namespace reactivations (except when the
original namespace is still on the scope stack), and template instantiation
scopes.

Note that for namespace extension and reactivation scopes, kind will have
been changed to sck_namespace if the symbols for the namespace are
still on the active list (this routine will not be called for such
scopes).

scope_depth is the index into scope_stack for which symbols are being
considered.  locator is the symbol locator for the name being looked up.
lookup_state is used to pass state information between the various routines
that do normal id lookup processing.

WARNING: A scope stack lookup may involve lazy loading of symbols which may
cause scope_stack to be re-allocated, invalidating any saved pointers into the
scope stack.  Any such pointers will need to be reset after a call to this
routine.

When a normal lookup reaches an instantiation scope and, after considering the
template parameters, still has not found a symbol, the context of the
instantiation must be considered.  The context has two components: the
definition context (where the template was declared or defined) and the
referencing context (the namespace containing the reference that caused the
instantiation).

The symbol may be found in one or both of the contexts.  If the symbol is
found in both contexts, both instances must be functions.

The two lookups are done by calling scope_stack_lookup with the
appropriate set of starting and ending scopes.  The ending scopes
specified will result in all scopes having been considered up to
a "common" scope at which the two lookup paths come back together.
The two lookups could result in zero, one, or two symbols being found.
If no symbols are found, the search resumes from the common scope.
If one symbol is found, the search also begins with the common
scope but any symbol found from the common search is used as the
"second" symbol (i.e., the one for which no symbol was found
in the defining/referencing searches).  If two symbols are found,
either from the defining/referencing search or as a result of
finding one in the defining/referencing search and one in the
common search, the two symbols are merged and result in either
an overload set or an ambiguous symbol.

scope_depth is the index into scope_stack for the template instantiation
scope.  locator is the symbol locator for the name being looked up.
lookup_state is used to pass state information between the various routines
that do normal id lookup processing.

WARNING: A scope stack lookup may involve lazy loading of symbols which may
cause scope_stack to be re-allocated, invalidating any saved pointers into the
scope stack.  Any such pointers will need to be reset after a call to this

Do a qualified lookup of namespaces nominated by using directives
in this scope.  This is used for qualified namespace and file scope
lookups.  For functions, the symbol returned may be an overload set
containing functions from several namespaces.  For nonfunctions,
an ambiguity may need to be diagnosed.

locator describes the symbol being looked up.  ns_scope is the namespace
(or file scope) in which we should look for the symbol.  if ns_scope is
a namespace, ns_ptr points to the namespace.  options are the lookup options
to be used.  orig_ns_ptr is the namespace specified in the qualifier.
*synth_sym points to a synthesized projection symbol that captures the
results of the lookup.  *any_errors is set to TRUE if an ambiguity is
detected.

  namespace B { int j;    void g(int);  using namespace D; }
  namespace A { int i;    void f();     using namespace B; using namespace C;}

A qualified lookup begins with the namespace specified by the qualifier.
If the name is found there, the lookup stops.  If it is not found there,
the lookup looks in each of the namespaces used in using directives in
that namespace.  Functions from each namespace are merged together
into an overload set.  If more than one name is found, and they are not
all functions, the lookup is ambiguous.

Using the example above, the result of the following lookups are
as follows:

	Lookup		Result
 	------		------
	A::i		A::i
	A::j		B::j
	A::k		C::k
	A::l		ambiguous (in D and E)
	A::f()		A::f()
	A::g(1)		B::g(int)
	A::g('x')	C::g(char)
	A::g(2.0)	ambiguous (B::g or C::g.  D::g is hidden)

inline_namespace_only is TRUE if a symbol was found in a given namespace
and that symbol can overload with symbols from inline namespaces (or
named in strong using-directives in g++ mode).

If no symbol is found in the specified namespace, NULL is returned.

the classes and namespaces associated with the template argument list).
locator is the symbol locator associated with the name that is being looked up.
When include_std_namespace is TRUE, the std namespace is included in the lookup
as an associated namespace (e.g., for range-based-for).

normal_sym, if not NULL, is included in the symbol list that is returned

a sk_routine, sk_overloaded_function, or sk_namespace_projection symbol.

duplicate entries.
