/*
Token kinds.

The front end conceptually has two categories of tokens: "simple tokens" and
"complex tokens".  "Simple tokens" are tokens that have a single form.
"Complex tokens" are tokens that have (practically) innumerable distinct forms
(like identifiers, numbers, etc.) or "pseudo tokens" that cannot be spelled
(like an end-of-source token or an IFC entity ref token).

"Complex tokens" should be listed before the tok_last_complex_token constant.

If this enumeration is changed, be sure to change token_names (below) and
opname_kind_for_token (lexical.h).

In addition, the token handling code for modules must be updated.

For "simple tokens", it's sufficient to use an EDG "textual" IFC token; this
requires adding the token kind to the ifc_ebts_complex case of
token_to_basic_token_kind (ifc_modules_write.c).  If the name entered into
token_names (below) for the new token is not unique, additionally, a case in
ifc_token_name_of (returning a unique name) must also be added (as otherwise
the deserialization of the IFC encoding to the front end token kind is
ambiguous).

For "complex tokens" (as described above), the gen-ifc-map tool should be used
to add new IFC node representation of the token.  Once the "IFC Map"
(i.e., ifc_map.h) has been updated via the tool, the writing
(an_ifc_il_map::enter_token_cache in ifc_modules_write.c) and reading
(cache_edg_token_cache in ifc_modules_read.c) code must be updated to make use
of the new IFC node.

sequence entries (allocated in the file scope memory region) that may be
thought of as successors of the sublist-parent; similarly, the successor of
the sublist's final source sequence entry would be sublist-parent->next.
(The function-scope source sequence list is logically a single list but is
actually discontinuous, with sublist branches, because entities allocated
in the file-scope memory region cannot have pointers into a function-scope
memory region.  Similarly, there is no pointer back from the sublist
header to its parent since the former is allocated in file-scope memory and
the latter resides in function-scope memory.)  There can be any number of
sublists in a given function's source sequence list; the headers are linked

although the Microsoft documentation describes the contents of an

permits any fragment of a statement or declaration to be specified in
the block.  Our emulation of __if_exists in the front end permits this
usage too.  However, when source sequence entries are created for
__if_exists blocks, the starting and ending markers are recorded in
the source sequence list, which means that the C++-generating back end
can only correctly recreate an __if_exists from IL in cases where the
the __if_exists block contains a complete statement or declaration.
At this time, __if_exists entries are only created for uses that appear
in class definitions.  Most other uses (at least in the Microsoft headers)
do not conform to the rules described above.  If an __if_exists appears in
a class in a way that violates the rules above, an error is issued.

__if_exists entries are only created for __if_exists blocks in which
the tested entity is a dependent name.  When the __if_exists is not

     Some platforms support __float80 and __float128 typedefs to designate
     floating point types.  If those types are distinct from the standard
     types, they are represented using fk_float80 and/or fk_float128

     type -- if so, fk_long_double is used in both cases).

     The extended floating-point types (described in WG21 document P1467R9)
     must follow the traditional types, as promoted_float_kind relies on
     this ordering.

     exprutil_init() and init_field_alignment_tables() with the appropriate

     being described; in other words, it represents the steps of a cast from
     the derived class to the base class.  For instance:
                                                                       A

     In the context of C the derivation of direct base class B has one step
     (==>B) and that of indirect base class A has two steps (==>B==>A).  A
     virtual base class may have several paths.  For instance:
                                                                       A

                                                                       C
     In the context of C virtual base class A has two derivations: as a
     direct base class (==>A) and as an indirect base class (==>B==>A).  An
     indirect base class that is itself a base class of a virtual base class
     has multiple derivations as well, but only the segment of the derivation
     from the intervening virtual base class is explicitly represented in the
     IL.  For instance, modify the preceding example as follows:       X
                                                                       |
        class X { };                                                   A
        class A : public X { };                                      / |
        class B : virtual public A { };                             B  |
        class C : public B, virtual public A { };                    \ |
                                                                       C 
     The derivation path for X is represented as ==>A==>X, but since A is a
     virtual base class with two derivations, this is tantamount to ==>A==>X
     (where A is a direct base class of C) and ==>B==>A==>X (where A is an
     indirect base class of C).  The two paths for X are inferred by
     supplementing the derivation entry for X, which points to the path
     ==>A==>X, with the two derivation entries for A, the direct one and the
     indirect one.  Since there may be several virtual base classes in a

     attribute: The modified field will point to an entry of type
     a_property_or_event_descr (recording the names of the names of the "get"
     and "put" functions).  The other kind is obtained using C++/CLI syntax
     involving a context-sensitive keyword "property".  For example:
         ref struct S {
           property int p1 { int get(); };
           static property char p2 { void set(char); };

     functions (which have special_kind sfk_property_get or sfk_property_set)
     also point to the associated a_property_or_event_descr.
     There is only one kind of event syntax and it is valid only in C++/CLI
     mode.  Its syntax is similar to that of C++/CLI property constructs but
     involves the context-sensitive keyword "event".  For example:
         ref struct S {
           delegate bool A(void*);
           event A^ actions {
             void add(A^);
             void remove(A^);
             bool raise(void*);
           }
         };

     this case; each with its own special_kind value.

As the "gnu_extra_info" (aka a_gnu_routine_supplement) field of a_routine is
allocated on an as-needed basis, the following macros are intended to hide some
of the mechanics of allocating the supplement when using fields in
a_gnu_routine_supplement.  Each macro takes an a_routine_ptr argument.

ensure_gnu_routine_supp can be used when assigning a value to a field in the
"gnu_extra_info" supplement and it is not known if the supplement has been
previously allocated (the supplement is then allocated in this case).
For example:

  ensure_gnu_routine_supp(routine)->asm_name = "foo";

gnu_routine_supp can be used when accessing a field in the supplement and,
based on external information, it is assumed that the "gnu_extra_info" field
has previously been allocated.  For example, if routine->has_ctor_priority is
TRUE, then the following expression can be used to return the value of
ctor_priority (and an assertion will be generated -- when CHECKING is TRUE --
if the "gnu_extra_info" field has not been allocated):

  priority = gnu_routine_supp(routine)->ctor_priority;

has_gnu_routine_supp is used to test whether or not the field has been
allocated.

gnu_routine_supp_or_null behaves the same as gnu_routine_supp when CHECKING is
FALSE.

When the expression node kind is "enk_builtin_operation", these are the
possible operations.

Note that the value of enumerators in this list is used as part of the mangled
name encoding for builtin operations, so the items on this list should not be
reordered; if they are, it will cause an ABI incompatibility (in the names of
templates).  For this same reason, we avoid making any of these enumerators
configuration-dependent (e.g., the GNU-specific bok_types_compatible is part of
the list even when GNU_EXTENSIONS_ALLOWED is FALSE).

Additionally note that in some cases the difference between "builtin
operations" and "builtin functions" can be hazy.  If a builtin takes a type
argument, it must be a builtin operation, otherwise a builtin function is often
a better fit.

If you add an operation to this list, be sure to update
builtin_operation_names.
