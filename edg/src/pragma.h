The pragma binding kinds indicate the ways in which a pragma may relate
to the surrounding constructs.  The binding kinds differ in how they
are handled in cached vs. non-cached contexts.  This table summarizes
the processing of the various pragma binding kinds:

			Processed		Processed
Kind			when encountered	when rescanned
----------		----------------	--------------
immediate		yes			yes
next_token		no			yes
preproc_immediate	yes			no
next_construct		no			yes
other			not applicable		not applicable

"Processed when encountered" means that the pragma is processed even if
it is encountered in a context that is being cached to be scanned later.
"Processed when rescanned" means that the pragma is processed when the
token with which it is associated is rescanned from a cache.
