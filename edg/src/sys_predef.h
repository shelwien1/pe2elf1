The following macro (NS_alias_templ_intrinsics) describes alias templates in
namespace std that the front end recognizes and attempts to substitute
intrinsically.  The macro takes another macro M that should be of the form:

  #define MACRO(ns, name)

Different parts of the front end invoke NS_alias_templ_intrinsics to
  1) define (here, in sys_predef.h) enumerator constants identifying the
     intrinsics by number,
  2) define a table (in symbol_tbl.c) used to (a) mark associated symbol
     headers for efficient identification, and (b) build a Ptr_map to
     associate a "signature" to match function declarations with, and
  3) produce switch cases (in sys_predef.c) to handle substitution dispatch.

To recognize a new alias template intrinsic named xyz in a namespace N:
  a) Ensure there exists a variable of type a_symbol_ptr named
     symbol_for_namespace_NS (for some unique identifier NS) that 
     represents namespace N.  See, e.g., make_symbol_for_namespace_std,
     which initializes symbol_for_namespace_std (NS = std) and
     symbol_for_namespace_std_meta (NS = std_meta).
  b) Add a line
         M(NS, xyz)
     in the macro below.
  c) Add a function named subst_NS_xyz in sys_predef.c that resolves the
     alias (see, e.g., subst_std_remove_cv_t for the required signature and
     an example definition).

                           seven potential parts (in the following order):

                             - prefix ('S') [optional]
                             - emulation ('L', 'g', or 'm') or
                               "standard" ('s')
                             - mode ('c', '+', or 'x')
                             - arch ('A', 'R', or 'X') [optional]
                             - bits ('4' or '8') [optional]
                             - version (version range in parens) [optional]
                             - restrictions ['v', 'i', 'f', 'c'][optional]

                           A prefix of 'S' indicates that the name in the
                           entry (which must start with "__builtin_") also
                           has a secondary declaration with the same type
                           but without the "__builtin_" prefix.  It appears
                           that secondary declarations are only used by GCC
                           to give warnings on a redeclaration of the function
                           (typically a library function) in C mode, so these
                           secondary declarations are not entered into the
                           symbol table in C++ mode.

                           The 'L' emulation mode indicates that the function
                           applies to clang mode; 'g' indicates GNU mode, and
                           'm' is for Microsoft emulation mode.

                           A mode of 'c' indicates C mode, '+' indicates
                           C++ mode, and 'x' indicates both C and C++ modes.

                           An 'A', 'R', or 'X' indicates the function applies
                           only to architectures where target_is_arm_based,
                           target_is_riscv_based, or target_is_x86_based is
                           TRUE, respectively.

                           A '4' indicates the function applies only to
                           architectures where target_is_64_bits is FALSE
                           and an '8' indicates the function applies only to
                           architectures where target_is_64_bits is TRUE.

                           If a parenthesized range of applicable versions is
                           given, the function is only enabled when the version
                           is within that range.  Either end of the range can
                           be dropped; e.g., "gc(40800-)" means the attribute
                           is valid in GNU C mode with gnu_version >= 40800.

                           If restrictions exist, they are a non-empty
                           sequence of the following characters:
                             'c' - indicates that the signature depends on
                                   the char8_t type
                             'f' - indicates that the signature depends on
                                   128-bit floating-point types
                             'i' - indicates that the signature depends on
                                   128-bit integer types
                             'v' - the signature depends on vector types
                           If a function with restrictions is referenced, a
                           check is made to ensure that all restrictions are

This table contains entries for "manually added" builtin functions.  The

This table may also be used to "override" signatures and/or condition entries
for builtins whose entries in the automatically-generated table are found
to be incorrect (i.e., a matching entry here will prevent the loading of the
same entry in builtin_table).

Note that any entries in this table are lazily loaded, i.e., they are
loaded into the symbol table for each translation unit, but a routine entry
(and associated symbol) are not created until the builtin function is
referenced.  If the builtin function must be defined each time, a different
mechanism (e.g., calling enter_builtin_function directly) should be used.
